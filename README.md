# Pan-Tilt-Head-Robot-With-Camera-Objects-and-Faces-Detection-Using-OpenCV-and-Python
I)Description:
The Pan-Tilt-Head-Robot aims to detect and track objects and faces. It consists of a Pan-tilt-head system, a camera and an Arduino board. 
-The Pan-tilt-head is composed by two servo motors. It help the camera to stay centered upon an object. 
-The Camera is attached to the pan-tilt-head in order to take pictures instantaneously. 
-The Computer treats the images from the camera. After that, it sends the decisions to the Arduino board. 
-The Arduino board receives the decisions from the computer and sends commands that makes the first servo pan left or right and makes the second servo tilt up or down. 
To program this Robot, i used Arduino, python and OpenCV (the OPEN source Computer Vision library for image processing).
